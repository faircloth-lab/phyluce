Phasing UCE data
================

The following steps should be included into the UCE workflow after you extracted the target contigs from the assembly files, which represent UCE loci. The target-contig FASTA file (e.g. ``dataset1.fasta``) contains all contig sequences of interest. However, any diploid individual may have more than one sequence at each individual UCE locus. This allelic information lies in the reads for each sample and can be recovered by allele phasing.

In this approach we use the fastq read data and map them against the recovered UCE contig sequences. This collects all the read variation at each given locus for each individual. In a subsequent step all matching reads for each locus are phased into two separate allele bins. We then create a consensus sequence of each allele bin separately and export all allele FASTA sequences into a joined FASTA library.

Separating the contig FASTA library
-----------------------------------

First we will have to split the contig FASTA file (e.g. ``dataset1.fasta``) into sample specific FASTA databases, which will serve as the sample specific templates for the following mapping. You can do this in two simple steps:

1. Deposit all sample names/IDs into a text file named ``sample_IDs.txt``. Each sample ID should occupy an individual line in the text file. This file will be used in the next step by iterating through each line and extracting all sequences containing the stated sample ID in the FASTA header inot a separate FASTA file. Make sure to use the exact sample IDs as they occur in the contig FASTA file.

.. attention:: Make sure that the sample IDs are unique. This can be tricky when having names like ``genus_species1`` and ``genus_species10``, since when searching for the former one (``genus_species1``) all sequences for both samples (``genus_species1`` and ``genus_species10``) will be returned. To avoid this it is recommendable to add an underscore after each sample ID (e.g. ``genus_species1_``).

2. Run the following command in the command line after altering the paths to the contig file (``dataset1.fasta``) and to the output fasta files (``${sample}_contigs.fasta``):

.. code-block:: bash

  for sample in $(cat sample_IDs.txt); \
      do grep $sample -A 1 /path/to/uce/taxon-set1/dataset1.fasta > /path/to/uce/taxon-set1/sample_specific/${sample}_contigs.fasta; \
      done



Creating a configuration file
-----------------------------

Before you run the script, you have to create a configuration file, telling the program where the cleaned and trimmed fastq reads are stored for each sample and where to find the contig FASTA library for each sample.
The configuration file should look like in the following example and should be saved as e.g. ``phasing.conf``::

    [references]
    genus_species1:/path/to/uce/taxon-set1/sample_specific/genus_species1_contigs.fasta
    genus_species2:/path/to/uce/taxon-set1/sample_specific/genus_species2_contigs.fasta

    [individuals]
    genus_species1:/path/to/clean-fastq/genus_species1
    genus_species2:/path/to/clean-fastq/genus_species2

    [flowcell]
    genus_species1:XXYYZZ
    genus_species2:XXYYZZ



[references]
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section you simply state the sample ID (``genus_species1``) followed by a colon (``:``) and the full path to the sample-specific FASTA library which was generated in the previous step.



[individuals]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section you give the complete path to the cleaned and trimmed reads folder for each sample.

.. attention:: The cleaned reads used by this program should preferably be generated by illumiprocessor_ as the folder structure of the cleaned reads files is assumed to be that of illumiprocessor_ . This means that the zipped fastq files (fastq.gz) have to be located in a subfolder with the name ``split-adapter-quality-trimmed`` within each sample-specific folder.

[flowcell]
^^^^^^^^^^


Mapping reads against contigs
-----------------------------

To map the fastq read files against the contig reference database for each sample, run:


.. code-block:: bash

    phyluce_snp_bwa_multiple_align \
        --config /path/to/phasing.conf \
        --output /path/to/mapping_results \
        --subfolder split-adapter-quality-trimmed


This will produce an output along these lines::

Phasing mapped reads
--------------------

In the previous step you mapped the reads against the contig FASTA file for each sample. The results are stored in the output folder in bam-format. Now you can start the actual phasing of the reads. This will sort the reads within each bam file into two separate bam files (``genus_species1.0.bam`` and ``genus_species1.1.bam``).
The program is very easy to run and just requires the path to the bam files (output folder from previous mapping program, ``/path/to/mapping_results``) and the path to the configuration file, which is the same file as used in the previous step (``/path/to/phasing.conf``):

.. code-block:: bash

    phyluce_snp_phase_uces \
        --config /path/to/phasing.conf \
        --bams /path/to/mapping_results/ \
        --output /path/to/phased_reads


The output is supposed to look like this::

The program automatically produces a consensus sequence for each of these phased bam files (= allele sequence) and stores these allele sequences of all samples in a joined FASTA file (``joined_allele_sequences_all_samples.fasta``). This allele FASTA is deposited in the subfolder ``fastas`` within your output folder (e.g. ``/path/to/phased_reads``) and can be used as input for the following alignment steps.
