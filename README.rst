phyluce_ (phy-**loo**-chee) is a software package that was initially developed
for analyzing data collected from ultraconserved elements in organismal genomes.

The package now includes a number of tools spanning:

- the assembly of raw read data to contigs
- the identification of UCE contigs
- parallel alignment generation, alignment trimming, and alignment data summary
  methods in preparation for analysis
- alignment and SNP calling using UCE or other types of raw-read data.

As it stands, the phyluce_ package is useful for analyzing both data collected
from UCE loci and also data collection from other types of loci for phylogenomic
studies at the species, population, and individual levels.

Please see the `Documentation <http://faircloth-lab.github.com/phyluce/>`_ for
additional information on using phyluce_

.. _Installation:

Installing
----------

We **strongly** suggest installaing phyluce_ using anaconda_/miniconda_ and the
conda_ package manager for python_.  We build and test phyluce_ dependencies and
function on the following platforms.

- Apple OSX 10.9.x
- CentOS 6.x
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Quick version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Install JAVA for your platform
#. Install anaconda_ for your platform (Instructions_)
#. Check that anaconda_/miniconda_ are installed and in your ``$PATH``::

    python -V
    Python 2.7.6 :: Anaconda 1.8.0 (x86_64)

#. Add the `faircloth-lab binstar`_ repository to your ``.condarc``::

    conda config --add channels http://conda.binstar.org/faircloth-lab

#. Install phyluce_::

    conda install phyluce

For more in-depth installation instructions, see the `Installation documents`_.

Issues
------

If you have an issue, please ensure that you are experiencing this issue on a
supported OS (see :ref:`Installation`) using the conda_ installation of
phyluce_.  If possible, please submit a test case demonstrating the issue and
indicate which platform, git checkout, and phyluce version you are using.

Citing
------

If you use `phyluce`_ ,please cite the `phyluce`_ repository using:

Please also cite the following manuscript, which describes the first use of the
computer code as well as the general approach.  We should soon have an
additional manuscript for the software, alone.
